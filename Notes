Page Factory:

Advantages:
1. Reduced Verbosity --> It means it reduces writing driver.findElements();
2. Faster to find elements --> @cacheLookUp --> First time it will find element from DOM. From next time it will fetch from cache
3. Lazy evaluation --> 

Disadvamtages:
1. It cannot be used for Dynamic Web Elements
2. StaleElementExceptions
3. NullPointerException


DataProvider:
1. If we use for loop then total test run will be 1.
   Example: for login used three different set of data using for loop then total test run will be 1.
   If 1st set of data is failed then we don't know the result of next set data.
   
   Test count will be 1 even if we run same test case 100 times with different set of data.
   If 1st set of data is failed then we don't know the result of next set data.
